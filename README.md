# MovePlanner


I did this project as a simple learning project to learn how ajax requests work with API's.

In this project, the user will be asked to enter to the street and city where he plans to moves. And the website will respond by showing him the street view of that place( Street View Api). He will also be shown the latest New York Times articles involving that place (NY times api) and he will shown the link to wikipedia links for that place(wikipedia search api).
